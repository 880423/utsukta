### लक्ष्य एवं उद्देश्य

<em>Utsukta</em> is an initiative with an aim of promoting the spirit of free inquiry. The motivation behind starting this project can be summed up in the following points:

* Exploring different facets of human life and improve our understanding of them.
* Reach a wider audience and make science accessible to public who often struggle with finding relevant and easy to understand articles.
* Providing our audience with facts and logical arguments which would enable them to form a well informed opinion.
* Motivate our readers to imbibe a spirit of free inquiry.

In order to fulfil our objectives, there are certain methods that we will adopt.
 
* Using the principles of science to find the truth.
* Using scientific research to shape our way of living.
* Engage in constructive debates about topics that affect us.

Staying true to our purpose of dissemination of knowledge and building a society where seeking truth is above all is our priority. To this end we do not write articles on individuals, personalities or associated phenomenon. Instead our focus is on the mechanisms and factors that lead to such phenomenon in society.
